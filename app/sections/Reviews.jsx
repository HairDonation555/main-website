But you were so gracious enough to guide me through the whole process of removing and packing the hair properly, up to collecting it from my place. Everything became so much easier. Thank you. Also many thanks for your kind and encouraging words to someone like me shaving for the first time. Keep up your noble work hairdonation555!",
